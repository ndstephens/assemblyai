This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install all packages locally:

```bash
npm install
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Additional Info

I understand the project was intended to take approximately 4 hours. I chose to have some fun while creating it for my own learning opportunity and enjoyment.

Additional time was spent on:

- Creation of custom images.
- Basic landing page / banner.
- A few animations

Creation of the main store, shopping cart, and usage of Zustand for state were all done in roughly a 4 hour window.
